Welcome to the 35th edition of our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 35!

We have made significant advancements in enhancing our product. The integration feature we shipped will enable quick-start monitoring for popular technologies in SigNoz.

Letâ€™s see what humans of SigNoz were up to in the month of March 2024.

## What we shipped?

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.42.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.42.0</a>

Previous Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.41.1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.41.1</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.40.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.40.0</a>

### Quick-Start Monitoring with Seamless Integrations

We have shipped integrations for MongoDB, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Redis to make it easier for our users to set up monitoring for these technologies. After configuring the steps mentioned in the instructions, users can get access to pre-built dashboards with important logs and metrics from their integrations. 

Go to `Integrations` tab and choose any integration that you need.

    <figcaption><i>Create dashboards with important logs and metrics quickly with the help of integrations</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Configure the integrations with the steps mentioned under `Configure` tab. For example, you can configure your MongoDB integration to collect logs and metrics.

</figure>
<br/>

You can expect more integrations coming in future releases to make monitoring your application and infrastructure with SigNoz a breeze.

### Support for Email as an alert channel

We have introduced support for Emails as an alert channel. SigNoz users now have the ability to receive alerts directly in their inboxes, making it easier than ever to stay on top of critical issues as they happen.

    <figcaption><i>You can configure Emails as a notification channel</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Upgraded functionalities for setting up alerts

**Support for Alerts on Missing Data**

We've enhanced our alert configuration options to include alerts for missing data, applicable across all signal types - metrics, traces, and logs. This feature proves invaluable in scenarios where certain hosts or segments of your application cease transmitting data, ensuring you're immediately alerted to potential issues or downtimes.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/signal-35-setup-alert.webp" alt="Set up alerts in case of missing data"/>
    <figcaption><i>Set up alerts in case of missing data</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

**Ability to customize the alert frequency**

Earlier, each alert condition was checked every 1 minute, and it was not configurable to change this. Now, you can click on `More Options` to configure how frequently you want your alerts to run. 

It is useful to users in some use cases and helps them with some computing costs. For example, an external data system might send data every three hours. You can set the alert frequency to check alert thresholds accordingly.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

    <figcaption><i>You can now customize the alert frequency</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Download logs in Excel and CSV format

You can download your filtered logs in Excel and CSV format from our logs explorer page. This comes in handy in use cases where you are required to share some specific logs with folks who donâ€™t have access to SigNoz.

    <figcaption><i>Download logs in excel and csv format</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Ability to clone queries in query builder to quickly build complex queries

The query builder is one of SigNoz's most powerful features. We have added the ability to clone a query in our query builder. This will help users start from a previous query and build complex queries faster.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/signal-35-clone-query.webp" alt="Clone a query to start building complex queries faster in our query builder"/>
    <figcaption><i>Clone a query to start building complex queries faster in our query builder</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Daily breakdown in billing for better transparency

For SigNoz Cloud users, we've introduced a new feature that shows daily costs based on how different signals are used in the `Billing` tab. This way, we help our users understand their SigNoz usage better and make sure they're getting real value for their money.

    <figcaption><i>Get complete visibility on whatâ€™s driving your observability costs</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Ability to filter services based on their environment

Now, in the Services tab, you can filter services by their environmentâ€”like dev, prod, and staging. This makes it easier to check how services perform in different settings, helping users quickly get the insights they need.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/signal-35-filtering.webp" alt="Filter services by their environmentâ€”like dev, prod, and staging"/>
    <figcaption><i>Filter services by their environmentâ€”like dev, prod, and staging</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Ability to pin common attributes in the logs context tab

You can now pin commonly occurring attributes to identify your logs quickly in the logs context tab. Logs context tab is accessible by clicking on any log line that you want to view.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/04/signal-35-pin-attributes.webp" alt="Pin commonly occurring attributes in the logs context tab"/>
    <figcaption><i>Pin commonly occurring attributes in the logs context tab</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

### Select and change variables even when dashboards are locked

In many use cases, you might find it necessary to implement role-based access controls to allow different users within your organization to access dashboards. However, while you may not want someone to alter any configurations, you might still want to enable them to analyze the data using different variables. Now, you can select and change variables even when dashboards are locked, enhancing flexibility without compromising on security.

## SigNoz News

### SigNoz at Kubecon Paris

SigNoz team was at Kubecon Paris, and this time we were delighted to present a talk too. Srikanth, our in-house OpenTelemetry expert, talked about building dynamic observability pipelines using OpAMP in OpenTelemetry.

If you want to see this feature in action, check out the Pipelines feature in our logs module which enables you to parse and update attributes in ingestion time. So, you no longer need to configure all the attributes/parsing during log generation or collection.

Hereâ€™s a full video of the talk ðŸ‘‡
