Ruby on Rails is a popular MVC framework for creating web applications. It is necessary to monitor your Ruby applications for performance issues. In todayâ€™s cloud-native and microservices-based architecture, it is difficult for engineering teams to troubleshoot performance issues.

Tracing your application can give the much needed context required to troubleshoot performance issues. OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that can help you to set up an observability framework for your cloud-native applications.

> **What is Distributed Tracing?**<br></br>
> Distributed tracing is a method to track user requests in their entirety as it travels across components of a distributed system. 

A single user request might go through hundreds of services before serving the user what they need. Using OpenTelemetry client libraries, you can collect tracing data from your Ruby applications to monitor how user requests are performing across services.

The tracing data can then be visualized using an observability tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/). Before we demonstrate how to implement the OpenTelemetry client libraries for a Ruby application, letâ€™s have a brief overview of OpenTelmetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source vendor-agnostic set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

The telemetry data is then sent to an observability tool for storage and visualization.

OpenTelemetry is the bedrock for setting up an observability framework. It also provides you the freedom to choose a backend analysis tool of your choice.

## OpenTelemetry and SigNoz

In this article, we will use SigNoz as our backend analysis tool. SigNoz is a full-stack open-source APM tool that can be used for storing and visualizing the telemetry data collected with OpenTelemetry. It is built natively on OpenTelemetry and works on the OTLP data formats.

SigNoz provides query and visualization capabilities for the end-user and comes with out-of-box charts for application metrics and traces.

Now letâ€™s get down to how to implement OpenTelemetry Ruby libraries and then visualize the collected data in SigNoz.

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

## Instrumenting a Ruby on Rails application with OpenTelemetry

**Step 1: Install dependencies**

Install dependencies related to OpenTelemetry SDK and exporter using gem.

```go
gem install opentelemetry-sdk
gem install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-all
```

Include the required packages into your gemfile.

```go
gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
gem 'opentelemetry-exporter-otlp'
gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-all'
```

To install dependencies run: 

```
bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database: 

```
rails db:migrate
```


**Step 2: Initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK**

Initialize the otel sdk by adding below lines to `config/environment.rb` of your Ruby on Rails application.

```jsx
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require_relative 'application'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end

Rails.application.initialize!
```

**Step 3: Running your Ruby application**

Now we have to set the following environment variables to export the collected telemetry data for storage and visualization.

- `OTEL_EXPORTER` : It is the format of exported data. Since SigNoz natively supports otlp so it should be set as `otlp`

- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` : Name of Service (anything you want)

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` : Specify the endpoint of OTEL collector in format `https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443`.

- `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` : The ingestion key sent by SigNoz over email. It can also be found in the `settings` section of your SigNoz Cloud UI.

You can copy the SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY and OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT from your dashboard settings page. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/05/signoz-key-region.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US |	ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN |	ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

Using the above mentioned environment variables, run the application:

```jsx
OTEL_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-access-token=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY \
rails server
```

## Monitor your Ruby on Rails application with Signoz

After following above steps, you can now monitor your Rails app with SigNoz. You can use this [sample Ruby on Rails app](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-rails-app) that was instrumented using above steps to see how the collected data is visualized with SigNoz dashboard.

To run the sample app use below commands

- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Migrate database: `rails db:migrate`
- Run the app with env variables:

```jsx
OTEL_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=ruby-app \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-access-token=SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY \
rails server
```




Now the app should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

    <figcaption><i>The sample Ruby on Rails application monitored on SigNoz dashboard. The other applications are sample apps that come bundled with SigNoz installation.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

Play around with the app to generate some demo monitoring data, which will automatically be exported to the SigNoz Otel collector.

Now navigate to [https://xxxx-xxxx.in.signoz.cloud/services](https://xxxx-xxxx.in.signoz.cloud/services) (needs signup) to analyse the telemetry data of Rails app.

    <figcaption><i>The sample Ruby on Rails application monitored on SigNoz dashboard. The other applications are sample apps that come bundled with SigNoz installation.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

You can analyze your tracing data with powerful filters using the `Traces` tab on SigNoz dashboard.

Using Flamegraphs and Gantt charts, you can see a complete breakdown of your request.

<br></br>

SigNoz also provides Log management. The logs tab in SigNoz has advanced features like a log query builder, search across multiple fields, structured table view, JSON view, etc.
