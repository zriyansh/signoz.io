Both DataDog and New Relic are popular monitoring tools that provide a wide range of products covering different aspects of application and infrastructure monitoring. In this post, I have compared Datadog and New Relic on important features like APM, log management, infrastructure monitoring, OpenTelemetry support, etc. 

:::info
üí° I instrumented a sample Spring Boot Application and sent data to Datadog and New Relic to evaluate my experience. Some takeaways are subjective and based on personal preference.

## Datadog vs New Relic: Overview

For application monitoring, both Datadog and New Relic offer the same features. The difference lies in the actual user experience. Datadog has features for security management like Cloud SIEM, which is lacking in New Relic.

My research found that Datadog gives you more granular controls, while New Relic feels simpler to start with.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the overall platform features and functionality of Datadog and New Relic.

## APM: Datadog for more control, New Relic for Simplicity

I instrumented a sample Java application and sent data to both Datadog and New Relic for APM. The steps are almost the same in both Datadog and New Relic, with New Relic having a few extra steps. Both New Relic and Datadog require you to install their agent as well as a programming language-specific agent, which, in my case, was a Java agent.

In Datadog, I had a hard time figuring out whether my setup was complete or not, and I found the onboarding flow of New Relic much better.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-onboarding-tabs.webp" alt="Datadog's onboarding tab"/>
    <figcaption><i>Datadog‚Äôs onboarding flow is a bit overwhelming, with too many horizontal tabs.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

The good thing about Datadog is it gives you a lot of control. You can set up things like collecting custom metrics (which might be [expensive](https://signoz.io/blog/datadog-pricing/)), sampling rate, and telemetry correlation between traces and logs right from the beginning.

Once the setup is done, you can see your list of [spans](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/) and corresponding [flamegraphs](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/) for your traces. Datadog does a good job of correlating different types of signals. You can relate info from infrastructure, metrics, network, etc., right from trace data if you have those products enabled.

<br></br>

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-apm.webp" alt="Datadog APM"/>
    <figcaption><i>Datadog‚Äôs APM showing breakdown of an internal server error</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

New Relic‚Äôs traces page shows Trace groups instead of a list of spans, which feels like a cleaner representation, and you can filter by root spans, which comes in handy in case of large trace groups.

<br></br>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-apm.webp" alt="New Relic APM"/>
    <figcaption><i>New Relic groups spans in Trace groups and shows important metrics about it.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

You can get flamegraphs for your traces in New Relic, too. Compared to Datadog, New Relic has fewer options for correlation. But it is interesting to note that New Relic shows much more spans for the same call in my Java application.

<br></br>

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-traces.webp" alt="New Relic Traces"/>
    <figcaption><i>New Relic‚Äôs Flamegraph view of traces - you can also check out corresponding logs</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Overall, if you need a simpler experience, then choose New Relic‚Äôs APM. But if you need more control over what things you can do with your data, then choose Datadog‚Äôs APM.


## Log Management: Datadog for more filters, New Relic for quick-start

### New Relic

New Relic automatically collected logs from my Java application and showed them in their logs tab. It allows you to search your logs using Lucene, an open-source search library that allows for indexing and searching of text by breaking down text into searchable terms.

New Relic also gives you the option to query your log data using NRQL. It‚Äôs a query language developed by New Relic which has a SQL-like syntax.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-log-management-dashboard.webp" alt="Log Management Dashboard in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log Management Dashboard in New Relic showing logs from instrumented Java application</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Other key features in New Relic‚Äôs log management and how they worked with my Java application logs are:

- Takes out attributes automatically from logs.<br></br>

    <figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-log-attributes.webp" alt="Log Attributes in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Attributes filtered from Java application logs in New Relic</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br/>
    
- It provides a feature called patterns, which claims to make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time. However, it couldn‚Äôt detect any pattern in my Java application logs.

- Gives you tools to manage your log data by optimizing for storage by dropping filters.

### Datadog

For Datadog, there was no automatic collection of logs. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog agent, and you need to enable it in the agent‚Äôs config file. You also need to activate a java integration that will collect application logs from a file.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-logs-tab.webp" alt="Log Tab in Datadog"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log Tab in Datadog showing logs from my Spring Boot Application</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Both Datadog and New Relic have a feature to find patterns in logs automatically. While Datadog showed some patterns from my application logs, New Relic did not. Datadog offers more options to slice and dice your log data in its UI. 

Both tools provide ways to optimize log data ingestion at scale. Datadog allows you to use your own cloud storage for logs, which seems to be a handy feature for storing logs for the long term.

Compared to New Relic, setting up log collection took more time in Datadog. But Datadog provides more visualization options to see your logs.



## Infrastructure Monitoring: Tie, decide based on cost

Host monitoring in both Datadog and New Relic is good, and choosing one over the other can be a matter of personal choice. I personally like the color theme of New Relic and the representation of things like Disk usage in a table.

What‚Äôs interesting about Datadog is that it showed me a glimpse of the JVM metrics dashboard while clicking on my host. Datadog has done a really good job at correlating different types of information collected from your application and host.

<br></br>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/datadog-infrastructure.webp" alt="Datadog infrastructure tab"/>
    <figcaption><i>Datadog showing JVM metrics without any configuration was a good experience</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

<br></br>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/new-relic-host-monitoring.webp" alt="New Relic Host Monitoring Dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>New Relic‚Äôs Dashboard for Host monitoring</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

If your use case is only infrastructure monitoring, then the decision comes down to cost. However, it‚Äôs not easy to figure out how much each tool will cost on a head-to-head basis as their pricing structures are very different. I recommend you sign up and do a trial for both tools, including factors like user seats(New Relic charges for user seats).

## Pricing: Beware of these things

Both Datadog and New Relic are expensive tools. The following points might help you decide which tool is better suited for your needs:

### New Relic

- Pricing is based on two things:
    - Amount of data ingested
    - User Seats
- You get 100GB of free data ingest each month.
- Post 100GB, you need to pay $0.3/GB or $0.5/GB ingested based on your plan.
- [User seats](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-user-based-pricing-collaborate-seamlessly-with-signoz) can get expensive. New Relic allows only 5 full platform users in its standard plan, and the cost of full platform users can be up to $549/user per month for enterprise plans.

### Datadog

- Datadog is known for being very expensive - here‚Äôs a <a href = "https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/datadog-65m-year-customer-mystery/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >scoop</a> on Datadog‚Äôs 65 million dollar bill.
- Complex SKU-based pricing. Each product(like APM, logs, infra) is priced differently, and it‚Äôs very hard to predict your actual usage.
- Datadog defines its standard set of metrics; anything outside that definition falls under the category of custom metrics. If you‚Äôre not careful, the [cost of custom metrics](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz) can be a significant component of your billing.

## OpenTelemetry Support: Not Great in Both Datadog & New Relic

OpenTelemetry is quietly emerging as the open-source standard for collecting all types of telemetry signals. There are numerous [benefits](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-use-cases/#opentelemetry-vs-vendor-based-agents-for-application-instrumentation) to using OpenTelemetry for collecting telemetry data from your applications and host.

Both Datadog‚Äôs and New Relic‚Äôs support for OpenTelemetry is [not up to the mark](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/), which seems reasonable as their entire product is anchored around their specific agents. 

For example, Datadog cannot link traces and logs automatically with the [DataDog OpenTelemetry](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-vs-datadog/) tools. New Relic‚Äôs documentation is better for using OpenTelemetry, but once the data gets reported, you can see the difference again.

<br></br>

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/09/firsclass-6.webp" alt="OpenTelemetry data in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>OpenTelemetry data is segregated in New Relic and not included in the APM experience.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

If you are looking to use OpenTelemetry, then I would recommend [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) (of course) - an OpenTelemetry-native APM. And just like OpenTelemetry, SigNoz is also open-source. So you can have a full-stack open-source observability stack with SigNoz and OpenTelemetry.

## Datadog vs New Relic: Final Verdict

You should choose Datadog over New Relic if you are an observability expert and want more granular control over your data. That said, New Relic is not far behind in terms of features offered and can be a good solution for application observability.

Here‚Äôs a use-case-based guide for Datadog vs New Relic:

- If you want a better correlation between your signals, then choose Datadog.

- If you want to use the entire platform without worrying too much about billing, then choose New Relic, as the pricing is based on usage.

- If you want more granular controls over your data, choose Datadog.

- If your use case is Cloud SIEM, then choose Datadog.

- If your use case is real-user monitoring, then choose New Relic.

Datadog and New Relic are great products for application monitoring and observability, but they are mostly suited for bigger enterprises. And if you‚Äôre looking to use OpenTelemetry, then neither product is that well-suited. SigNoz is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that can be used as an alternative to Datadog and New Relic.

## Advantages of using SigNoz over Datadog and New Relic

Datadog and New Relic have been leaders in the application monitoring domain for many years. But they are not suited for everyone. SigNoz can be a great choice as an alternative to Datadog or New Relic. Some of the advantages of using SigNoz over Datadog and New Relic are:

- **Open-Source**<br></br>
  SigNoz is open-source, just like OpenTelemetry. Being open-source, SigNoz is more suited to use cases where privacy is a concern, as it can be self-hosted. It can also be used in a hybrid way - using open-source for the dev and staging environment and [cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) for the production environment.

- **OpenTelemetry-native**<br></br>
  OpenTelemetry is one of the leading open-source projects backed by CNCF and second only to Kubernetes when it comes to popularity. It is also safer to have an open-source standard deeply integrated with your application and infrastructure rather than a vendor-specific agent. OpenTelemetry frees you from vendor lock-in.

  SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry from day 1. Our APM experience is based fully on OpenTelemetry data, and we provide features that utilize OpenTelemetry data well.

- **No user-based & host-based pricing**<br></br>
  You can add as many team members as you like when using the SigNoz cloud service. There is no charge for user seats in SigNoz. There is also no host-based pricing. You only pay for the amount of data you send.

- **No special pricing for custom metrics**<br></br>
  Custom metrics are important for getting application-specific insights. You understand your business best, so only you will be able to decide what things need to be monitored. Sending [custom metrics in Datadog](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz) can get really expensive, and there are many horror stories about unpredictable billing in Datadog.

## Issues with existing monitoring vendors

DataDog and New Relic are great monitoring tools and provide a gamut of monitoring products that any organization can use. But these enterprise monitoring tools can have the following issues:

- Crazy node-based pricing
  Node-based pricing doesn‚Äôt make sense in today‚Äôs micro-services architecture. Any node which is live for more than 8hrs in a month is charged. So, unsuitable for spiky workloads

- Very costly
  These tools are very costly if you want to do things like sending custom metrics.

- Cloud-only
  Hence, not suitable for companies that have concerns with sending data outside their infra

- Closed product roadmap
  For any small feature, you are dependent on their roadmap. We think this is an unnecessary restriction for a product which developers use. A product used by developers should be extendible

The other alternative can be going for an open-source alternative. But the problem with most open-source products is that they are resource-intensive to set up, maintain and scale up. That's where [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) comes into the picture. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open-source APM platform with easy configuration and scalable architecture.

## An alternative to DataDog and New Relic - SigNoz

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool which can be used in place of DataDog and New Relic. SigNoz is built to give SaaS like user experience combined with the perks of open-source software. Developer tools should be developer first, and SigNoz was built by developers to address the gap between SaaS vendors and open-source software.

Key architecture features:

- **Logs, Metrics, and traces under a single dashboard**<br></br>
  SigNoz provides logs, metrics, and traces all under a single dashboard. You can also correlate these telemetry signals to debug your application issues quickly.

- **Native OpenTelemetry support**<br></br>
  SigNoz is built to support <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>OpenTelemetry</b></a> natively, which is quietly becoming the world standard to generate and manage telemetry data.
