Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to collect, monitor, and analyze data from various AWS resources, applications, and services in real-time.

CloudWatch is a good tool for monitoring AWS, but it gives you limited visibility. You also need a centralized monitoring tool if you’re monitoring things outside of AWS. In this article, we will go through top CloudWatch alternatives that you can use.

CloudWatch provides insights into the operational status, health, and performance of your AWS infrastructure and applications. However, once your application grows, you need a dedicated observability tool to understand performance issues in your application.

## Top CloudWatch Alternatives

Below are some of the top CloudWatch alternatives:

1. [SigNoz](#signoz-open-source)
2. [Prometheus](#prometheus)
3. [Grafana](#grafana)
4. [Datadog](#datadog)
5. [New Relic](#new-relic)
6. [Dynatrace](#dynatrace)
7. [AppDynamics](#appdynamics)
8. [Sematext](#sematext)
9. [LogicMonitor](#logicmonitor)

## SigNoz (Open Source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a great CloudWatch alternative to take observability and performance monitoring of your applications to the next level. It provides logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass, along with easy-to-use alerting.

SigNoz leverages the power of ClickHouse, a columnar database known for its exceptional efficiency in processing and storing log data. This makes it an ideal choice for robust log management and analysis.

SigNoz also provides both metrics monitoring and distributed tracing. You can correlate application metrics and traces easily with a single click. For example, if your application is having high latency, you can dig into traces at that particular timestamp to understand performance bottlenecks.

You can also create custom dashboards for monitoring your infrastructure.

</figure>

SigNoz also provides detailed views of tracing data in the form of Flamegraphs and Gantt charts. Gantt charts make it easy to visualize your services and events in a parent-child relationship tree. You can easily figure out which events are causing latency in a request call. All of this comes out of the box with SigNoz.

## Prometheus

<a href = "https://prometheus.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a> is an open-source monitoring tool that collects and stores metrics data in a time series database. It operates on a pull-based architecture, actively gathering time-series metrics from monitored services, ensuring real-time access to critical information.

Prometheus achieves this by scraping metrics data from HTTP endpoints and subsequently pushing it into a database designed with a multidimensional model, allowing for thorough contextual monitoring. This model is backed by a powerful query language, PromQL, enabling dynamic querying and aggregation of the collected metrics.

Additionally, Prometheus offers robust built-in alerting capabilities, service discovery mechanisms, and seamless integration with visualization tools like Grafana, providing a comprehensive and powerful monitoring solution.

## Why use a centralized monitoring tool instead of CloudWatch?

CloudWatch is a good monitoring solution while starting out in AWS. But as your application grows, you need a robust monitoring tool that gives more visibility into your application performance. A few things you should consider while selecting a monitoring tool to move out of CloudWatch:

- **Multi-cloud capabilities**<br></br>
  The CloudWatch alternative you choose should be able to monitor services in multi-cloud architecture. It should be a centralized monitoring system that can handle monitoring all components in your tech stack whether it’s a part of AWS or not.

- **Metrics, logs, and traces**<br></br>
  Using a single tool for all your monitoring needs helps consolidate the engineering bandwidth you spend on monitoring. Using a single tool for logs, metrics, and traces also helps to correlate different signals for better insights.

- **Ease of shifting out**<br></br>
  You should use a tool that is easy to get started with. A tool that helps in getting CloudWatch metrics easily will make the process of shifting out easier.

- **Pricing**<br></br>
  Monitoring data is huge, and different vendors bill differently. A tool like [Datadog](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz) can get costly very soon. You should choose a tool that provides good value for your money.

SigNoz is a great CloudWatch alternative that provides logs, metrics and traces under a single pane of glass. It comes with great out-of-the-box charts for application metrics, database calls, apdex, and much more. The log management in SigNoz is also highly scalable, with an advanced query builder to search and filter logs quickly.
