In microservices architecture, observability tools enable you to create central dashboards to gauge the health of your distributed systems. New age observability tools have shifted to providing quick workflows to debug application issues. In this post we will explore top 11 observability tools that you can consider to use for your software systems.

In today's digital economy, distributed architectures have become the norm. Organizations are also opting for polyglot microservices to boost developer productivity. But how do you manage the operational challenges of such systems?

Customer experience is the key to the success of tech companies of any size, be it startups, mid or large-level enterprises. You need to proactively solve for things like availability and performance of your applications in production.
And that's where observability comes into the picture. A robust observability framework is now critical for maintaining your systems in fine health. Observability is powered by telemetry data - a combination of logs, metrics, and traces.

## What is an Observability Tool?

The aim of observability is to solve customer issues quickly. Creating monitoring dashboards is useless if it can’t help engineering teams quickly identify the root causes of performance issues.

A modern distributed software system has a lot of moving components. So while setting up monitoring, you might not know what answers you would need to solve an issue. And that’s where observability comes into the picture.

An observability tool enables application owners to get answers to any question that might arise while debugging application issues. Usually, an observability tool helps you to monitor three signals - metrics, traces, and logs.


<!-- A good observability tool has many components:

1. It should enable you to generate, sample, process, and emit telemetry data.

2. It should have a good storage system for fast retrieval and long-term retention.

3. It should have a good visualization layer for your teams to consume and take action.

In this article, let's explore the top 9 observability tools in 2023 which can be perfect for your microservice application. -->

The easiest way to use Elastic APM is by subscribing to the hosted Elasticsearch service on Elastic Cloud. You can also opt to self-manage the Elastic stack, where you need to decide how to run and configure the APM server.

Some of the key features of Elastic APM include:

- **End-to-End Distributed Tracing**: Provides comprehensive tracing of transactions across various services.
- **Real User Monitoring**: Captures and analyzes user interactions with front-end applications.
- **Error Tracking**: Identifies and helps in analyzing application errors effectively.
- **Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning**: Uses advanced machine learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in application performance.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Visibility**: Offers insights into the impact of code changes on application performance.


### Zipkin

    <img src="/img/blog/2023/09/zipkin-distributed-tracing.webp" alt="Zipkin dashboard showing traces"/>
    <figcaption><i>Zipkin dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

Zipkin is an open source APM tool used for distributed tracing. Zipkin captures timing data need to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. In distributed systems, it's a challenge to trace user requests across different services. If a request fails or takes too long, distributed tracing helps to identify the events that caused it.

Zipikin was initially developed at Twitter and drew inspiration from Google's Dapper. Unique identifiers called Trace ID are attached to each request which then identifies that request across services.

Zipkin's architecture includes:

- Reporters to send data to Zipkin
- Collectors which persist trace data to storage
- API to query data
- UI

Zipkin's in-built UI is limited, and you can use Grafana or Kibana from the ELK stack for better analytics and visualizations.

## How to choose the right observability tool?

For applications with microservices architecture, observability tools have become critical to meet operational challenges at scale. Without observability, it is almost impossible for your engineering teams to troubleshoot bugs and assess the performance of your applications. Hence choosing the right observability tool for your application is important. A few questions to ask yourself before selecting an observability tool are as follows:

- Are there any privacy laws that you need to take care of while sharing user's data with a third-party tool?
- Does the pricing suit your budget?
- How easy is it to get started with things like instrumentation?
- How much data do you want to retain?
- Does the tool provide seamless integration between metrics, logs, and traces?

An open-source tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), can be your best option in today's privacy-driven digital economy. Moreover, SigNoz uses open-source standards for instrumentation, and its code can be assessed for quality from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz). Finally, as the tool is open-sourced, you get the support of the community while having access to out-of-box features like a SaaS vendor.
