> What is a distributed tracing tool?<br></br>
> A distributed tracing tool enables you to track user requests across multiple servers and services in a microservice architecture. It gives you a central overview of how user requests are performing in different services.

Distributed tracing tools have become a critical component in a distributed and microservices-based architecture.

So why is distributed software so popular?

There are three major reasons for the popularity of distributed software: scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

But it also comes with its own challenges. Distributed software becomes complex with scale, and no single team can fully comprehend how all services interact. Although engineering teams own single services, they become implicitly responsible for many services.

A single user request can travel through hundreds or thousands of microservices. So to quickly identify where things are going wrong, you need a central overview of how requests are performing across services.

Distributed tracing tools capture user requests as they travel through every service and measure things like latency.

A great distributed tracing tool can improve your team's response to performance issues, thereby improving the end-user experience.

Here's the list of the top 13 distributed tracing tools we will be looking at in this article:

 - [SigNoz (Open-Source)](#signoz-open-source)
 - [Jaeger (Open-Source)](#jaeger-open-source)
 - [Zipkin (Open-Source)](#zipkin-open-source)
 - [Grafana Tempo](#grafana-tempo)
 - [Serverless360](#serverless360)
 - [Dynatrace](#dynatrace)
 - [New Relic](#new-relic)
 - [Honeycomb](#honeycomb)
 - [ServiceNow Cloud Observability](#servicenow-cloud-observability)
 - [Instana](#instana)
 - [DataDog](#datadog)
 - [Elastic APM](#elastic-apm)
 - [Splunk](#splunk)

Before we deep dive into each of these distributed tracing tools, let's take a short detour to understand distributed tracing.

## What is Distributed Tracing?
In the world of microservices, a user request travels through hundreds of services before serving a user what they need. To make a business scalable, engineering teams are responsible for particular services with no insight into how the system performs as a whole. And that's where distributed tracing comes into the picture.

</figure>

<br></br>

Distributed tracing gives you insight into how a particular service is performing as part of the whole in a distributed software system. There are two essential concepts involved in distributed tracing: **[Spans](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/)** and **[trace context](https://signoz.io/blog/context-propagation-in-distributed-tracing/)**.

**[Read our complete guide on Distributed Tracing](https://signoz.io/distributed-tracing/)**

User requests are broken down into spans.

> What are spans?<br></br>
> Spans represent a single operation within a trace. Thus, it represents work done by a single service which can be broken down further depending on the use case.

A **trace context** is passed along when requests travel between services, which tracks a user request across services. Thus, you can see how a user request performs across services and identify what exactly needs your attention without manually shifting through multiple dashboards.

<br></br>

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack distributed tracing tool that you can use for tracing your application. You can monitor logs, metrics, and traces and correlate signals for better insights into application performance. Logs, metrics, and traces are considered to be the [three pillars of observability](https://signoz.io/blog/three-pillars-of-observability/) in modern-day distributed systems.

SigNoz is a very good choice for distributed tracing based on OpenTelemetry. With SigNoz, you can do the following:

- Visualise Traces, Metrics, and Logs in a [single pane of glass](https://signoz.io/blog/single-pane-of-glass-monitoring/)
- Monitor application metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints.
- Find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed [flamegraphs](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/) of individual request traces.
- Run aggregates on trace data to get business-relevant metrics
- Filter and query logs, build dashboards and alerts based on attributes in logs
- Monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage
- Record exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript
- Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder


SigNoz is a great fit for engineering teams looking for an open-source distributed tracing tool. SigNoz also offers cloud and enterprise plans. This makes it a great choice for teams that want the flexibility of having their dev and staging environment on open-source and their prod services monitored by SigNoz cloud.

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for code instrumentation. OpenTelemetry provides vendor-agnostic instrumentation libraries and is quietly becoming the world standard for generating and managing telemetry data.


### Jaeger (Open-Source)

<br></br>

<a href = "https://www.jaegertracing.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>Jaeger</b></a> is an open-source APM tool developed at Uber, later donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF). Inspired by Google's Dapper, Jaeger is a distributed tracing system.

It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. Some of its key features include:

- Distributed context propagation
- Distributed transaction monitoring
- Root cause analysis
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance / latency optimization

Jaeger supports two popular open-source NoSQL databases as trace storage backends: Cassandra and Elasticsearch. Jaeger's UI can be used to see individual traces. You can also filter the traces based on service, duration, and tags. However, Jaeger's UI is a bit limited for users looking to do more sophisticated data analysis.

### Zipkin (Open-Source)

Zipkin's architecture includes:

- Reporters to send data to Zipkin
- Collectors which persist trace data to storage
- API to query data
- UI

Zipkin's in-built UI is limited, and you can use Grafana or Kibana from the ELK stack for better analytics and visualizations.

It also includes a dependency diagram that shows how many user requests went through each service. It can help you to identify error paths and calls to deprecated services.

## How to choose the right distributed tracing tool?

Tracing user requests is now critical for maintaining an exemplary user experience. Yes, distributed tracing directly impacts end-user experience as it gives your teams the right insights in the right amount of time to act on issues affecting application performance.

In our view, distributed tracing tools should be developer first tools. As developers directly utilize these tools in critical situations, the codebase of the tools should be open-source. Open-source is the future of all software tools.

Transparency and collaboration are some key benefits of open-source software tools. Developers want to see the code first hand, and if there are issues they want to address, they prefer to reach out to an active developer community than a customer support team.

At the same time, most open-source tools don't provide the same user experience as provided by SaaS vendors. But it doesn't have to be that way. With that objective, we created SigNoz.

SigNoz is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool. It provides a unified UI for both metrics and traces. Log management is also in the product roadmap and will be launched seen.
