# Launching SigNoz Technical Writer Program

Are you a developer who loves creating content and getting it across to a global audience? We'd love to have you contribute to our community writer program.

We are an open-source Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool and we’re early into our journey (launched last year 🤓). We are building with our community, and now we want to create content with the community.

> Reach out to ankit.anand@signoz.io for more details on our Technical Writer program

We help developers like you to monitor applications and keep them in fine health. You can monitor application metrics like latency, requests per sec, error rates, etc. with SigNoz. There are a bunch of other things that we are good at. But that’s a story for another time! You can though check out our GitHub repo in a jiffy 👇

So, why are we here? We are here to talk about our technical writer program, and we’re so excited to launch it! 🚀

As an open-source project, we want to educate our community more about our project and about the concepts in our domain. And we need some helping hands 🙌

Let us first see what topics we’re looking at to create content around.

## Topics we love
We are looking for developers who can create content around these topics:

- **Using SigNoz** to monitor applications written in different languages and frameworks. For example, this [article](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-fastapi/). We want to make it easier for more devs to use SigNoz, so help us out! 🙏

- **OpenTelemetry**, for more info visit the [official website](https://opentelemetry.io/). It’s an open-source project under Cloud Native Computing Foundation, and there is a huge community behind it. As it’s an emerging technology, it is a very good topic to write about and educate fellow devs. 🤗

- **Distributed tracing**: It’s a concept essential to monitor applications based on microservices applications.

- **Application performance monitoring**: It’s a broad topic and relates to everything you do to measure and monitor your application’s performance. Feel free to tell us what you know, and what you would want to share.

- **Observability**: The new buzz in the town, or quite old already? We will love to have both beginner and experienced perspectives on this.

- **DevOps**: Any topic that helps DevOps engineers with their workflow is a good topic for us. For example, tutorials on Docker, Kubernetes, and other DevOps tools are topics that we are interested in.

We're open to your creative ideas. Feel free to apply!

<!-- - Anything and everything that relates to monitoring applications or improving application performance. A few examples of articles can be

You can also just reach out directly to ankit.anand@signoz.io with an introduction and few samples of your work. If you’re wondering why do this, then let us convince you.

## Why write technical content for us?

This will of course be a paid engagement. We will pay out **$150 or INR 11,000 for every article** published. But that’s just one aspect. Writing technical content online has other benefits too:

- **Build an authoritative online presence.**<br></br>
The topics that we deal with are either emerging technologies or concepts that need good technical understanding. Having published content around these topics will always act as a booster to your digital presence. We will have links to your social media handles, and short bio about you on your published articles.

- **Distribution of your content**<br></br>
Our blog gets thousands of visitors per month. Ever written a piece of content only to find that no one read it? Well, we care and are actually incentivized to take your created content to as many people as possible. Apart from our blog, your content will be shared across all our social handles and our slack community.

- **Improve your writing skills**<br></br>
Writing is a critical skill as you grow in your career and our team will help you write better with feedback and tips. Only practice can make you a better writer. And what better way to practice than to do it for a popular open-source project (pardon the bragging 😝)

Are you convinced? Even if you’re not, let’s give it a shot and see what happens. How does all of this work? Let’s read about the process a bit.

## How does the process work?

You just need to reach out to ankit.anand@signoz.io with an interesting idea and a short proposal. Once your proposal is accepted, we will provide you with a Notion workspace to get started.
