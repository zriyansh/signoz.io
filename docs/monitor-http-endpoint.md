With SigNoz, you can monitor the health of the HTTP endpoints and set up an alert in case of HTTP endpoints failure status codes.

## Steps

* Add the httpcheck receiver to `otel-collector-config.yaml` 
  ```yaml {2-10}
  receivers:
    httpcheck:
      endpoint: http://example.com
      method: GET
      collection_interval: 10s
  ```
  The HTTP Check Receiver can be used for synthetic checks against HTTP endpoints. This receiver will make a request to the specified endpoint using the configured method. This scraper generates a metric labelled for each HTTP response status class with a value of 1 if the status code matches the class.

* Next, we will modify the pipeline to include the receiver we have enabled above.
    ```yaml {4}
    service:
        ....
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [clickhousemetricswrite]
    ```

* We can restart the otel collector container so that new changes are applied and see the metrics generated for synthetic checks.

* This receiver creates a metric name `httpcheck_status` with value 1 if the check resulted in status_code matching the status_class, otherwise 0. For more info on the additional metrics and attributes available, please read the documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md).
