### Overview
To export Kubernetes metrics, you can enable different receivers in OpenTelemetry
collector which will send metrics about your Kubernetes infrastructure
to SigNoz. These OpenTelemetry collectors will act as agents which send
metrics about Kubernetes to SigNoz.

OtelCollector agent can also be used to tail and parse logs generated by
container using `filelog` receiver and send it to desired receiver.

Based on where you are running SigNoz ( e.g. in an independent VM or Kuberentes cluster),
you have to provide the address to send data from the above receivers.

## Steps to export Kuberentes metrics to SigNoz

By default, SigNoz Helm chart installs `k8s-infra` dependency chart which
handles the task of collecting metrics and logs from the Kuberentes cluster.

`K8s-Infra` helm chart mainly handles the following:
- Tails and parses logs generated by containers in Kuberentes cluster and sends to SigNoz
- Collects kubelet metrics and host metrics from each nodes of the Kuberentes cluster
- Collects cluster-level metrics from the Kubernetes API server
- Acts as a gateway to send any incoming OTLP telemetry data to SigNoz OtelCollector

:::info
Skip **Step 1** if you have single Kuberentes cluster for SigNoz and your applications
as `k8s-infra` chart is included in default SigNoz chart installation.
:::

1. **Install K8s-Infra chart**

   ```bash
   helm install my-release signoz/k8s-infra  \
     --set otelCollectorEndpoint=<IP-or-Endpoint-of-SigNoz-OtelCollector>:4317
   ```

   :::info
   If the OtelCollector endpoint is secured, you would have to enable `otelInsecure`
   configuration and often make other changes such as including either config
   or path to the TLS certificate and private key.

   In case of SigNoz Cloud, you would have to set `signozApiKey` configuration.
   :::

2. **Plot Metrics in SigNoz UI**

   To plot metrics generated from `k8s-infra` chart, follow the instructions given
   in the docs [here][4].

   Check out the [List of metrics from Kubernetes receiver][3].

3. **Import Dashboard with CPU and Memory Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with CPU and Memory metrics of Kuberentes cluster
   containers from [here][5].

4. **Import Dashboard with K8s Metrics**

   You can import dashboard with Kuberentes metrics of K8s cluster from [here][6].

5. **Generate and Import Dashboard with Node Hostmetrics**

   You can import dashboard with Node Hostmetrics of your Kuberentes cluster from
   [here][7].

In the Dashboard page of SigNoz UI, you can create your own widgets as per you
need using metrics from the [list below][3].
