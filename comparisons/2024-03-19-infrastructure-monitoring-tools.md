## What is Infrastructure Monitoring?

Infrastructure monitoring is the process of collecting, tracking, and analyzing health and performance metrics across an enterprise’s IT infrastructure components, such as the servers, networks, databases, apps, and services. Continuous infrastructure monitoring helps enterprises detect anomalies proactively and prevent surprises (e.g. sudden downtimes or latency issues). It enables timely response to performance degradation, minimizing service disruptions and preventing customer churn.

## Choosing an Infrastructure Monitoring Solution

When choosing an infrastructure monitoring tool, the following are key considerations to keep in mind to ensure that it meets your needs.

### 1. Integration and Resource Discovery

Choose a tool that seamlessly integrates with your entire stack, including containers, databases, orchestration tools, single and multi-cloud environments, and serverless functions. It must also automatically discover and scrape metrics from autoscaled resources such as storage instances, Kubernetes Pods, etc. Additionally, check that the tool can scale vertically (handling increased load on a single server) and horizontally (adding more servers to distribute load) with your organization's growth without compromising performance. These capabilities will ensure the tool is operationally efficient, requires no manual tuning, and leaves no resources untracked.

### 2. Comprehensive Data Collection

Consider a tool that can collect a wide range of data—including performance metrics, logs, traces, and user experience data—from all your backend components. It should also be able to correlate various telemetry types, tag resources and match telemetry to corresponding infrastructure—e.g. correlating performance metrics to availability zones—to provide DevOps teams with a holistic view and allow for swift detection of the specific service causing performance issues.

### 3. Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

The tool should provide real-time insights into CPU usage, disk space, network latency,  response times, failed requests, error rates, etc. This includes the ability to detect issues as they occur; for example, the solution must instantly detect and alert on issues such as packet dropping or excessive pod scheduling to allow your engineering teams to proactively address issues, optimize resources, and ensure seamless user experience.

### 4. Customization and User-friendly Interface

Look for a tool that provides customizable dashboards that give you quick overviews and visual representations of the state of the specific infrastructure components you want to investigate. Also, consider one that allows you to set up alerting thresholds for each metric, e.g., when traffic spikes, throughput drops, or databases approach their storage limits. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is crucial for fast setup, easy navigation, and seamless access to important metadata.

### 5. Automation and Remediation

Automation helps you streamline routine tasks and quickly address issues. Look for a tool that offers automated remediation options to save time, increase accuracy, and reduce the impact of incidents.

### 6. AI and ML Capabilities

Advanced infrastructure monitoring tools should leverage AI and ML capabilities to analyze data trends, predict potential issues, and provide intelligent insights to support decision-making.

### 7. Security and Compliance

Infrastructure monitoring data is an attractive target for cybercriminals; just as it provides your DevSecOps teams with infrastructure performance insights, it can also show attackers exploitable weaknesses in your systems. Choose a tool that offers robust security features—particularly encryption—to protect your data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
